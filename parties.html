Guests danced under glittering chandeliers, sipped champagne, and feasted on lavish buffets, surrounded by dazzling decorations. Jazz bands played lively tunes, filling the air with energy, while people strolled through the illuminated gardens and by the pool, lost in the enchantment of the night. </div>

A select few received handwritten invitations delivered by Gatsby’s servants, adding an air of exclusivity to the event. For many, these gatherings were a mystery, with guests mingling in Gatsby’s  mansion despite knowing little about their host</div>

There were the newly rich, loud and brash, eager to flaunt their wealth, and the city’s social climbers, clinging to any connection that might elevate them. Celebrities and politicians mingled with drifters and opportunistsall indulging in Gatsby’s endless hospitality without knowing—or caring—much about the man himself. Most came simply to be seen, to drink his champagne and dance in his garden, leaving only empty glasses and whispers in their wake.</div>
