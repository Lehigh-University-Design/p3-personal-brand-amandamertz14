            <p>Daisy was more than just a woman to Gatsby; she was an ideal, a vision of beauty and wealth that he had clung to for years, shaping his entire life around the hope of winning her back. She was the green light across the bay, something just out of reach that drove him to build himself up from nothing, constructing a world of wealth and grandeur to be worthy of her love. In the end, Daisy’s presence in Gatsby’s life was both the making and the unmaking of him, a dream that lifted him up and shattered him just as irrevocably.</p>

           <p>Tom Buchanan was more than just Daisy’s husband; he was the wall that stood between Gatsby and everything he dreamed of. He was a brutish force, full of arrogance and entitlement, and his dominance. Tom’s presence was a constant reminder of Gatsbys outsider status. Tom’s possessive hold on Daisy crushed Gatsby’s dream, leaving him as nothing more than a tragic casualty in the wake of Tom’s indifferent privilege.</p>

            <p>Jordan Baker’s role in Gatsby’s life was brief but significant. As Daisy’s close friend, she helped Gatsby orchestrate that first fateful meeting between himself and Daisy at my home, setting in motion the events that followed. In her nonchalant, almost careless way, she became a bridge between Gatsby’s dream and Daisy’s reality, her involvement revealing both the ambition and vulnerability at the core of Gatsby’s character. Jordan was a key to the revival of Gatsby’s long-lost love.</p>

            <p>To Gatsby, Meyer Wolfsheim was both a mentor and a gateway into the world of wealth and influence he craved. A shrewd and morally ambiguous figure, Wolfsheim profited from New York’s underworld, and he helped Gatsby amass the fortune he believed would win Daisy’s love. Yet when Gatsby fell, Wolfsheim distanced himself, exposing their relationship as one of convenience rather than true loyalty.</p>

            <p>In my own eyes, I was a careful observer, someone who prided himself on honesty and reserve—a listener who preferred to watch others rather than act impulsively. I came from a modest background in the Midwest, and this grounding gave me a perspective on wealth and ambition that was less enchanted, perhaps, than those around me. I often found myself caught between admiration and disillusionment as I navigated the lives of Gatsby, Daisy, Tom,</p>

            <p>and Jordan, feeling both drawn to their world and wary of it. Though I tried to remain impartial, I couldn't help but be affected by Gatsby's relentless hope and the careless extravagance of those who took advantage of it. By the end, I felt changed, my view of the world permanently tinged by the tragedy and beauty I had witnessed, and perhaps more disillusioned with the pursuit of dreams that ultimately led only to emptiness.m,</p>
