            <p>Jay Gatsby’s house was a sprawling mansion that stood as a monument to his wealth and dreams, an extravagant display of opulence designed to captivate and impress. Located in West Egg, it had all the grandeur of a European palace, with towering spires, marble floors, and grand staircases. Outside, the estate boasted vibrant gardens, a luxurious swimming pool,  </p>

            <p>The guests at Jay Gatsby’s lavish parties, spread endless rumors about his past and fortune. 
                Some whispered that he was a German spy during the war, while others insisted he had killed a man. 
                There were tales that he was the nephew or cousin of Kaiser Wilhelm, suggesting his wealth had sinister origins. 
                Others speculated that he was simply a successful bootlegger, attributing his fortune to illegal liquor sales. 
                These rumors, swirling among people who barely knew him, only added to Gatsby’s allure and mystique, making him an almost mythical figure. </p>

                He claimed to be the son of wealthy, deceased parents from the Midwest. 
                He also spun a tale of attending Oxford.
                 
                Gatsby further fabricated his life by telling people that he had inherited his wealth. These lies were part of his carefully constructed persona, designed to make him appear worthy of the life he dreamed of with Daisy.</p>
